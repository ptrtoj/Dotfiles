Personal Dotfiles
=================

This repo includes below.

Emacs
=====

System Dependency
-----------------

- hunspell
- various dictionary files (*.dic, *.aff)

Files
-----

There are 3 concepts under .emacs.d.

First, modular config can be used with init.el.modular.

Also, there's single init.el style config, init.el.orig.

But, I'm currently using org-mode config with README.org under .emacs.d.

You can use init.el.modular or init.el.orig with below,

  $ ln -sv ~/Git/Repo/Location/.emacs.d/ ~/.emacs.d

However, if you want to use README.org, you have to fix the tangle location,
and then use org-babel-tangle(C-c C-v t) inside emacs.

Vim
===

There's minimal vimrc under .vimrc.minimal, and also relatively full featured .vimrc.full.

You can use anything you want with below,

  $ ln -sv ~/Git/Repo/Location/.vimrc.full ~/.vimrc

Neovim
======

System Dependency
-----------------

- ripgrep
- fd

Currently, don't use neovim, but config is present under .config/nvim.

GnuPG
=====

- gnupg
- pinentry-mac
